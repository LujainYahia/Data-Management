# Data-Management
# Customer and Student Data Management

This Python script is designed to manage customer and student data. It creates files to store customer and student information, allows users to input customer details, saves them into a CSV file, and concatenates the contents of two CSV files.

## Files Created:

1. `customers.txt`: This file stores customer data in plain text format.
2. `students.txt`: This file stores student data in plain text format.
3. `customers.csv`: This file stores customer data in CSV format.

## Usage:

1. Run the script `customer_student_management.py`.
2. Follow the prompts to input customer details (name, phone, email).
3. To exit the input loop, type "quit" when prompted for customer details.
4. The customer details will be saved into the `customers.csv` file.
5. The script will attempt to concatenate the content of `students.csv` (if it exists) to `customers.csv`.

## Note:

- Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- This script assumes basic knowledge of Python and file handling.
